# md-toc

Generate a GitHub compatible table of contents from headings in a markdown file

## Why another one?

I want something for myself that does exactly what I need it to do and exposes all the levers that I
need.

Very much for my personal use. Bespoke if you will.

## Usage

```sh
npx @zeusdeux/md-toc  <input file path>  -  output generated markdown to stdout
npx @zeusdeux/md-toc  <input file path> <output file path>  -  write generated markdown to output file path
npx @zeusdeux/md-toc  --help  -  show this help message
```
